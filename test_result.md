# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User requested to clone a GitHub repository (https://github.com/PRASANNAPATIL12/weddingcard5.5.git) 
  and create a branch 'feat/route', then implement the following features:
  
  1. **Wedding Party Management**: 
     - Allow users to edit wedding party data in dashboard (bridal_party, groom_party, special_roles)
     - User-friendly form for adding/removing cards with photo, name, designation, description
     - Responsive card layout for desktop and mobile
     - Data stored in MongoDB per user
  
  2. **Guestbook Functionality**: 
     - Make guestbook functional on both landing page and dashboard

     - Display messages in "Messages from our loved ones" section
     - Real-time update when messages are submitted
  
  3. **Theme Switching in Dashboard**:
     - Fix theme switching functionality in dashboard sidebar
     - Apply theme changes instantly to entire dashboard (similar to navbar theme switching)
  
  User specified:
  - Do not make structural changes - keep everything exactly as cloned
  - Code is already updated but .md files are old  
  - Use provided MongoDB connection string
  - Implement with JPEG/PNG image support only
  - Make forms very user-friendly with clear icons and guidance

user_problem_statement: |
  Clone GitHub repository (https://github.com/PRASANNAPATIL12/weddingcard5.5.git) and create feature/guestbook branch.
  Keep everything exactly the same as in GitHub - no design changes. Implement the following features:
  1. Wedding Party Management: Allow users to edit/add/remove wedding party members with photos, names, designations, descriptions
  2. Functional Guestbook: Make guestbook form save messages to MongoDB and display in real-time
